# FirstCppProject
 First commit in awhile. Tackling C++ now following completion of Python the first half of the semester. 
 Enjoy the journey!
 - Here I explore things like finding how long it takes to double an investment amount earning 5% interest a year, to finding which car is better to buy based on purchase price and operating costs over a period of 10 years.
 - I also look into how long it takes for an account that starts out at $10000 to be depleted if $500 is taken out every month for college expenses
 - The other cpp files in here (volume and vending) are exercises calculating number of liters in a 6-pack and a two-liter bottle by adding them once calculated, then a vending machine that asks to input a bill value, subtract the price of an item, and spits out change in dollars and coins.
 - The initials cpp file creates initials for a user that enters first, middle, and last names.
 - The exponent cpp file squares, cubes, and finds the 4th power of a number entered by a user.
 - The circleProperties cpp file shows a program that finds the area and circumference of a circle, and volume and surface area of a sphere.
 - The drivingDistance function calculates cost per mile and distance based on gallons, miles per gallon, and price per gallon.
       - It also calculates the cost per 100 miles and the distance that can be driven with a given number of gallons of gas, and
       - It takes user input for the number of gallons, miles per gallon, and price per gallon.
