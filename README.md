# FirstCppProject
 First commit in awhile. Tackling C++ now following completion of Python the first half of the semester. 
 Enjoy the journey!
 - Here I explore things like finding how long it takes to double an investment aount earning 5% a year, to finding which car is better to buy based on purchase price and operating costs over a period of 10 years.
 - I also look into how long it takes for an account that starts out at $10000 to be depleted if 500$ is taken out every month for college expenses
 - The other cpp files in here (volume and vending) are exercises calculating number of liters in a 6-pack and a two-liter bottle by adding them once calculated, then a vending machine that asks to input a bill value, subtract an item price, and spits out change in dollars and coins.
